# linreg -- Linear Regression in 2D

The *aim* is to read a dataset of (x,y)-coordinates from a CSV file and calculate the parameters (m,n) for a linear fit <code>f(x) = mx + n</code> using gradient descent. Since this is a learning project, the use of libraries should be kept to a minimum.

Update:
* We can now fit an arbitrary number of features
